        <h2> Clotho </h2>
        <p> Most of my work was involved with: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Making the program compatible with current software, specifically MongoDB 3.4 and Jetty 9 </li>
                <li> Increasing the capabilities of Clotho's querying system </li>
            </ol>
        <p>In addition, I worked on the Java and REST API's, while also supporting other applications related to Clotho such as Garuda.</p>

        <h2> Fluorescent Protein Selection <span class="small text-muted font-italic"> Patent Pending </span></h2>

        <p> As my main project on a two man team, we created a wide use case tool to assist with flow cytometry tools. Designing and implementing an optimal selection algorithm, our goal for the tool is to simplify the costly and often uninformed set up of flow cytometers, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars even before the purchase of experimental materials. </p>
