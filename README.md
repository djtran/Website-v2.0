# Website-v2.0
Personal Website to soon will replace the original one at people.bu.edu/djtran

##Difference from original
Embracing a greater understanding of web development from my time at the CIDAR Lab, here's what's different:

Old:
 - Everything written from __scratch__
 - Reload a full HTML page with every link
 - Very static and unresponsive to user
 
New:
 - Bootstrap styling
 - AJAX style page loading
 - More javascript to create visually attractive transitions, increase interactibility with the website, and to respond to user input.
 
 If I had permissions on the people.bu.edu domain, I would take the extra step to create this website as a web application using Spring Boot and serve content such as my games packaged for HTML5 on the site.
