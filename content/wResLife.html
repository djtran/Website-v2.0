        <h2> Claflin Hall </h2>

        <p> As a Resident Assistant in Claflin Hall, I was responsible for building community on a floor of over 50 residents, acting as a resource and mentor figure for the floor. On the floor, I was tasked with building community and scheduling regular floor events every month. In addition, I was responsible for serving on a regular crisis response on-call rotation, responding to the immediate needs of more than 600 residents while on shift. </p>
